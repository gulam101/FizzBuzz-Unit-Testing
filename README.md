Unit Testing for FizzBuzz

Constraints:



Created the FizzBuzz project but then created unit tests to check if everything worked correctly. 

I learned more about unit testing and how they work, which enhanced my knowledge/understanding of them. This project was simply to test out the functions of the FizzBuzz.
