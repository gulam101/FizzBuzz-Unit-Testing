# FizzBuzz-Unit-Testing
Unit Testing for FizzBuzz

Description: In this project I created an application based on FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz is if the number is divisible by three it is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by fiver it will be called buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz.

Example: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz. This is a simple understanding of how the application functions.

What I learnt:
I learned more about unit testing and how they work, which enhanced my knowledge/understanding of them. This project was simply to test out the functions of the FizzBuzz.
