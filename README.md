# Unit Testing for FizzBuzz #

Description: In this project I created an application based on FizzBuzz. FizzBuzz is if the number is divisible by three it is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by fiver it will be called buzz. Numbers divisible by 15 become fizz buzz.

Example: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz. This is a simple understanding of how the application functions. 

But the next part of this application was to make sure how I would to see if the application was giving the correct number. I would write a simple unit test and then it would check for me. It would give a testing screen and if it was green then it would pass, and it will show the application was working. If it was red, then the application would throw an error and it would give a value which would be incorrect.

Instructions: The user loads up the application and it would show them the number from 1 - 100. It would show the user which numbers is Fizz, Buzz or FizzBuzz. 

Constraints: None

What I learnt: I learned more about unit testing and how they work, which enhanced my knowledge/understanding of them. This project was simply to test out the functions of the FizzBuzz.
